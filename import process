Download and install the AWS Command Line Interface. Set it up (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html and http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/VMImportPrerequisites.html)
Export your current VM [shut down VM, in vsphere select file -> export OVF template, select single file OVA, ideally uncheck cd/dvd inclusion]
Upload the exported image into your Amazon S3 bucket (using CLI) [cd to directory then #aws s3 cp amvmx-dc01.ova s3://amvianmexico/ —expected-size 894307685436]
import image file using ec2 import-image (use ec2 describe-import-image-tasks to monitor progress)[aws ec2 import-image --description "PCG1IT36-CL" --disk-container "{ \"Description\":\"First CLI task\", \"UserBucket\":{ \"S3Bucket\":\"amvianmexico\", \"S3Key\":\"pcg1it36.ova\"}}"] [aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks]
Create the instance using the AWS webgui, launch instance, and imported VM will be under ‘my AMIs’ - select appropriate specs for destination
set up networking:  VPC, subnet, route table, gateway, elastic IPs all need configuration (under VPC service), also make sure to look at security group settings, DNS hostnames if still having issues.
use remote desktop to connect to the new instance (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html) [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/troubleshooting-windows-instances.html#rdp-issues]
